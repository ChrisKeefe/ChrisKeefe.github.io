We left the E6 north of verangerbotn, for the Tanafjordveien,
and followed it around the fingers of the fjord's southern coast.

## On-road off-road adventures
We rode through at least a kilometer of rough work site road today,
where significant updates were being made.
Sections had been recently blasted,
and it looked like a new track was cut in at least one area.
Other than a few wordless orange reflector signs, there was no traffic management,
and there was a steady if sparse stream of cars, vans, campers, and semis passing through.
Growing up in the US, it was my assumption that the types of management we use,
lane closures, flaggers, traffic guides, etc would all be in use here too.
Clearly, that wasn't true.

Bumpy road aside, the experience was entirely positive.
Vehicles were (as usual here) generally polite,
and we even got a couple of enthusiastic waves from retirees up in camper cockpits.
Does the assumption that people can behave like adults encourage that kind of behavior?
Are there other cultural forces at work here? Is this just a weird Nord Norsk thing?

- sheeps! our first really positive sign of agriculture up here
- sled dog yards - because when it's not sunny 24 hours a day,
  grocery shopping is more fun with friends
