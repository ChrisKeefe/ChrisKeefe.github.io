## To Silfar Canyon

Our experience on the pass toward Mehamn taught us that elevation can mean a lot here.
I finally got around to planning a route with Komoot
instead of trying to scrape by on Google Maps (which seems increasingly hard to use lately).
Komoot's not perfect, but it is _such_ a better experience for touring,
making offline nav easy, and putting frequently-used trip stats
(e.g. time/distance to destination, elevation profile) right upfront.

Anyway, Selina in Ifjord told us there were flat spots on either side of the mountain
that could be good for camping,
and that the mountain was the easiest of the passes in the area.
Spot on, on both counts.

The tailwind made the low-angle climbing really fun.
The high country was weird and wide open and grey with babyhead rocks,
I found a super-neat dead reindeer
and did not pull off its antlers for arts and crafts purposes.
And when we coasted downhill past the Silfar Canyon,
we found ourselves in an amazingly vibrant birch forest,
with open undergrowth and lovely, soft, flat camp spots.

We did fancy ramen over a twig fire for dinner.
The Firebox Nano is a solid little machine and fun to cook with,
but probably underpowered for our purposes.
Using a branch, quartered and arranged around a central flue for kindling
brought much-needed stability and longevity to our cooking on it,
but it took forever to heat the liter and a half of water we needed to boil
in the steady wind we had.
Its ability to maintain a fire despite that wind, though, was super impressive.
The ramen was delicious.

## To Lakselv

Today's ride to Lakselv was, by all metrics, easier.
After a late sleep to avoid the morning's rain, I had a slow day though.
Everything felt harder.

On the plus side, we got up close to the pines of the world's northernmost pine forest,
and continued to enjoy the greening of the world.
Riding west through Finnmark at this time of year is magical for the transitions you see.
Eastern Finnmark is the coldest region in Norway, so heading west along the coast
feels like traveling through time while moving very slowly.
Spring is springing in fast forward, and the birds are ecstatic for it.

Lakselv's a bit grey,
but the restaurant on the north end of town makes a very servicable veggie pizza.
Green olives and pineapple is a weird combination,
but if the large pie we disappeared between us is any indication, it wasn't half bad.

## Old friends

- Snow machines are everywhere here, and called Scooterl√∏yper. I don't love em,
  but I do love their name!
- Mystery Nettles? They smell like nettles, and look like nettles,
  but they don't poke like nettles.

## New Friends

- Meese. Plural of moose. Lil baby ones, across the road from camp last night.
