<!-- TODO: PHOTOS -->

Here's the TLDR:
- we ate a bunch and bought stuff
- we went to Kirkenes, waaaaaay up north.

## shopping shopping shopping
Today we had to buy things, so we jumped on the tram and quested all over town.

Heidi bought a sim card/phone plan with MyCall - solid deal for travel,
with free voice and SMS to the states, and reasonable data rates.
I've been having a _great_ experience using my US Google Fi plan over here,
so decided to stick with that so my number stays active.
There's a chance they'll shut it down on me if I use it for too long here,
but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it.

We stopped at the Norwegian hiking organization (DNT)'s shop in search of maps,
had a great conversation, and found a set of 5 road maps that will give us enough
details to backstop us in case of cell signal loss.
While there, I joined the DNT for a year, which got us an access key for all the DNT huts.
They're affordably priced and sited in some cool places,
so hopefully we'll be able to make good use of that key.

Finally, the book store! And oh what a book store it was. 
We bought a couple of classic (or should-be-classic) Norwegian-author children's books,
and we'll try to learn en litt bit mer Norsk with them if we ever have the energy
after riding all day.
The book store's "cafe" was more like a library lounge,
but super comfortable, naturally lit, and with some kind of coffee contraption.
It was there that we planned our next move.

## Sentralen att. #2

After canceling dinner at Sentralen on night two, we decided to give it another shot.
It had an upscale feel, upper mid-tier price tag, decent if very formal service,
and interesting if not spectacular food.
Heidi and I have both relaxed our normal "veg unless we hunted it" food regime
while traveling here, and dinner notably included a very tasty bone marrow dish.
Heidi wound up with a plate of kinda weird lamb,
with _lots_ of butter and citrus or passionfruit notes in the herby sauce. Meh.
It was great to get out and celebrate our trip properly, and I'm very glad we
made it to Sentralen on the second attempt.

## Botanical gardens and walk along Motzfedtgate

After dinner, we took a walk out to the botanical gardens,
which I'm super excited to spend more time in if we make it back to the city.
We learned that Eastern North America's skunk cabbage is rapidly expanding its range here,
and glanced at the "Viking garden",
which collects plants important to early local populations.
Mostly, we spent our walk like lost tourists, searching for the bathroom.
I did the public a service and added a pin for the garden's WC to google maps.
May no one ever work so hard to find it again!

On the walk over, we rambled through a street carnival (complete with rides),
a super neat north/east African neighborhood I'd be interested in exploring,
and eventually past the barcode district,
named for it's skyline of black and white high-rise buildings.

## After the gardens (is the title of my next novel)

When we first arrived here, we had a heck of a time arranging bicycle storage,
and finally wound up taking our bikes (in a tiny shuttle)
to the B&B where we would spend our last night in Oslo.
It was time for the reunion.
We took the miraculous Flytoget train back to the airport,
met Camilla who was dancing on the side of the road,
chatted on the shuttle ride back to Gardermoen B&B, and headed up.

Heidi was feeling much better today, but still recovering from the sick.
She took a hot shower, while I went out into the night searching for history.
I saw an ancient stone thing (Vegstein?), tried to find a burial mound in the woods,
and scared the heck out of myself wandering around in the perpetual dusk,
so I ran full-tilt back to the hotel. Ridiculous human.

## To Kirkenes (pr. Sheer-kenes)
Luggage into shuttle, get on a plane, get off a plane, and build the bikes.
Norway's so different -
the airport staff couldn't have cared less what we were doing in their lobby,
and in the couple hours it took us to unpack, set up shop, re-assemble, pack our bags,
and head out for a test ride, exactly one guy came over to say hi.
In US, it would be everybody staring and saying something.

I got super bad wobbles, checked the headest preload,
and my headset's star nut started to slip. Uh-oh.
Fortunately, a star nut is mostly just responsible for bearing adjustment,
so I set the preload as well as I could,
tightened down the stem bolts and headed to town.
Tomorrow, we'll try to find a bike shop.

## New Friends
- The desk clerk at the Scandic Kirkenes, who called us crazy Americans,
  told us of the legend Lars Monson, and was super over-the-top helpful always.
  Thank you!
- Nox sweet licorice - like starburst but grown up just a little.
- Two kooky kids who spent their evening throwing soccer balls at buildings
  and mostly missing the windows. They decided to join us briefly for dinner.
