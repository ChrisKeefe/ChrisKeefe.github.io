I'm sure my word-count drop off dramatically soon,
but new places are so full of new experiences, and I'm going to run with it!

## A walk in the woods

We walked this morning, past park after park, over a pedestrian highway crossing,
on rocky coastal trails and through fairytale woodlands to the Folkemuseum. 
There were phtographers shooting local fashion among the reeds and rushes.
A young girl with a staff chased a fat old gnome past a video crew,
for what must be a painfully wholesome children's television show.


We were _in Oslo_, on the waterfront, within line of sight of a massive cruise ship,
and we walked in long wild meadows, past cows and birds and birds and birds.
There is so much _growing_ here, and I am deeply enamored with it.
