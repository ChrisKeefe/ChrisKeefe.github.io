Up late
broken eggs
road by 12:20
Great tailwind
unbelievable country from Bug√∏yfjord to Grassbakken
Suuuper windy lunch break at the park picnic area above the salmon farm
Met a puppy and two cute kids and (oh yeah) their mom
In Varangerbotn, we went shopping and bought a bunch of licorice
kids on bikes with wheelie skills and sweet sendoff
Camped in a funny little hollow on an unpromising hill above the lake just north of V-boten

## Old Friends
- crowberry, and lots of other plants similar to those in Healy, AK
- reindeer - but today, there are lots of them and they don't have collars on

## New Friends
- Reindeer (on leashes in someone's yard)
- Ptarmigan (which make very funny noises)
- Salty licorice, which is made with a weird salt (ammonia?)
