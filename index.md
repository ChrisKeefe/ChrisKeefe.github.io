Welcome to my little workshop.
It's messy but I like it here.

You'll find a bit of everything -
the obligatory developer profile,
a blog for notes, travel, tricks I pick up while building software,
and anything else that sparkles:
those perfect recipes you can build a meal or a whole life around,
the little projects I knock together in my spare time,
and photographs of the wild things I find in the woods.
I hope you find something you need here.
