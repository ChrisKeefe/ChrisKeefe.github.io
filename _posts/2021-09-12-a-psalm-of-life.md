If memory serves, I first found these lines in William Kennedy's _Albany Trilogy_.
I have loved them since. Their call to action has carried me into many adventures.
The poem's closing lines offer the patience and persistence that has led me safely home again.

> Let us, then, be up and doing,  
> With a heart for any fate

The poet frames these words explicitly as the voice of youth.
I wish for anyone who reads them, of any age, the bravery to keep learning new things.

### A Psalm of Life
\- H. W. Longfellow

_What The Heart Of The Young Man Said To The Psalmist._

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,  
   Life is but an empty dream!  
For the soul is dead that slumbers,  
   And things are not what they seem.  

Life is real! Life is earnest!  
   And the grave is not its goal;  
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,  
   Was not spoken of the soul.  

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,  
   Is our destined end or way;  
But to act, that each to-morrow  
   Find us farther than to-day.  

Art is long, and Time is fleeting,  
   And our hearts, though stout and brave,  
Still, like muffled drums, are beating  
   Funeral marches to the grave.  

In the world’s broad field of battle,  
   In the bivouac of Life,  
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!  
   Be a hero in the strife!  

Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!  
   Let the dead Past bury its dead!  
Act,— act in the living Present!  
   Heart within, and God o’erhead!  

Lives of great men all remind us  
   We can make our lives sublime,  
And, departing, leave behind us  
   Footprints on the sands of time;  

Footprints, that perhaps another,  
   Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,  
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,  
   Seeing, shall take heart again.  

Let us, then, be up and doing,  
   With a heart for any fate;  
Still achieving, still pursuing,  
   Learn to labor and to wait.
