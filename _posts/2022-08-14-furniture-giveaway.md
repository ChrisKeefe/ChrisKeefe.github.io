H and I are piling our stuff into a van and driving north soon.
We would like to have less stuff to pile up,
so we're giving away most of the furniture.
Let us know if you want any of these things -
everything unclaimed goes to a thrift store.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/double-bed-and-mattress.jpg)

Very decent double mattress intended for use without a box spring,
with low IKEA-style kit bed frame.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/kitchen-table-and-chairs.jpg)
IKEA table, in good shape except for a 5mm wide split running the full length.
Assorted chairs.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/coffee-table.jpg)
Scuffed but sturdy coffee table with shallow drawer for playing cards
or your hand-tatted doily collection.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/desk-and-chair.jpg)
It's a desk and a chair!

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/bookshelf-1.jpg)
Nothing fancy, but sure holds a lot of books.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/bookshelf-2.jpg)
This guy has done yeoman's work holding up houseplants,
and has the water damage to prove it.
Probably best for garage use at this point.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/end-table-and-lamp.jpg)
Nothing fancy, but in slightly better shape than most of our things.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/blue-table-and-printer.jpg)
Teal end table, and fully functional B&W Laserjet printer/scanner.
If no one needs a printer, we'll take this guy with us.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/futon.jpg)
This futon is a terrible color for staying clean,
and it will take real effort (or a cover) to make it look nice.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/futon-storage.jpg)
The engineering is awesome, though, and the storage inside has been a lifesaver.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/love-seat.jpg)
This, too, could use cleaning, but the dirt is less visible on a dark green background.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/ikea-chair.jpg)
Love this guy, just not worth moving it.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/kitchen-rack.jpg)
See previous comment. Decent rolling rack to store all of your kitchen stuff.
Unless you have as much kitchen stuff as we do,
in which case you'll need two more.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/pallet-shelf.jpg)
Unfinished shipping/display shelf from the dumpster behind Sprouts.
Looks surprisingly decent if you put enough plants on it,
but would do good work in a garage too.

![]({{ site.image-dir }}/{{ page.slug }}/shoe-racks.jpg)
Sooo many shoe racks. Please, take as many as you want.
