A year and half after our little pandemic wedding, H and I are going to Norway.
We'll ride our bicycles from north to south,
eating lots of pastries and making friends along the way.
We've got tickets through Oslo to Kirkenes, a commitment to doing as we please,
a loose intention to pedal from Kinnarodden to Farestad,
and a rough itinerary for the first week.

We don't, however, have anything packed yet. Here's what we think we'll bring.

## Food

Not much in this department, unfortunately.
The elk and venison jerky I made for the trip is disallowed by european customs,
and we're planning to buy groceries as we go.
We will, however, need things to hold, cook, and eat them with.

### Cookware
A 1.6l MSR pot will do most of the cooking for us, but we're scheming.
What if we cut the handle off a deep fry pan, and packed it along too?
Between the two, we'll have a lot of flexibility.
Cheese grillers and tomato soup, even,
or whatever the equivalent is in a country with scarce subtropical fruits.

### Food Storage
Bear cans are huge, but they don't leak and double as fantastic seating.
If we can fit one on a rear rack, it's coming along.

### Playing with fire
Canister stoves are super practical, and I love our little Olicamp Kinetic.
I don't love the amount of waste they produce, though.
Toting butane canisters around looking for a recycler isn't great.
We're going to play with a twig stove on this trip,
and see how often we can skip the fossil fuels.

## Water
We're expecting a wet trip,
and we should be able to cover ground quickly enough to reach water regularly.
A gravity filter for camp,
and chlorine drops for day use will make for convenient meals
and limited water weight on the bike.

## Shelter
Our old faithful tarptent double rainbow will do for sleeping,
but this is a vacation so we've got a "cooking shelter" along.
Lightweight tarps have gotten super expensive over the last few years,
so we're trying out the ground-cloth from a four-person tent as a substitute.
Reasonably compact, durable, and plenty of tie-off points.

## Electronics
Phones for navigation, bike lights for visibility,
and a small laptop for communication will draw a lot of power.
Solar's out because Norway, and generator hubs weren't in the cards.
We've got a couple of fat power banks, and a crazy power-strip/converter-thingy
to handle the 240->110v stepdown and the frequency difference to boot.

## First Aid, Repairs, and Tools
We're going pretty hard on this stuff.
Getting stuck or hurt up on the tundra just doesn't sound like fun.

## Clothes and Toiletries
We're hoping three shammies will give us enough depth to mostly avoid soggy mornings.
Contacts and sunglasses are 1000% better than glasses in the rain,
so that'll be the norm.
And of course, silk floss.

## Funtimes!
Two small backpacks for short overnights, plenty of reading material, and
journals to write in.
Add in a couple of tin whistles and a pair of pink goggles,
and it's going to be a blast!
