There are few things better than being invited into someone's home for dinner.
Slow travel makes that possible. Life goes by fast enough without our help.

## [Norway by bicycle](/tags/#norway)

My wife and I are spending summer of 2022 celebrating our marriage
(and our grad-school graduations) with a belated honeymoon bicycle tour of Norway.
We'll pedal over 4000KM from Kirkenes south to Oslo.
Or maybe we'll just stop at a good bakery along the way
and eat kardemommeboller until we pop.
There's no telling what the future holds.
