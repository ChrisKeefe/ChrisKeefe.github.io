There are few things better than being invited into someone's home for dinner.
Slow travel makes that possible. Life goes by fast enough without our help.

## [Norway by bicycle](/tags/#norway)

My wife and I spent the summer of 2022 celebrating our marriage
(and grad-school graduations) with a belated honeymoon bike tour of Norway.
We rode a winding 4500KM from Kirkenes south to Lindesnes.
I haven't finished writing up the adventure yet,
so for all you know, we stopped at the bakery in Ã…
and ate kardemommeboller until we popped.
There's really no telling.
