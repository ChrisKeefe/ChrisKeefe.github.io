I'm an [award-winning](/portfolio/#awardsscholarships) Masters Student in Computer Science.
I develop [research software for Microbiome Science](https://qiime2.org/)
with the [Caporaso Lab](https://caporasolab.us/),
and am *excited about building software that makes the world a better place*.

<!-- If you think your company fits that bill, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn. I am open for work in the US or abroad -->

I believe in well-made things, hard work, good food, and human connection.
When I'm not geeking out on open technology, you'll find me
[reading a book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/765208-chris-keefe)
or lost in the woods somewhere.
