I'm Chris, a software engineer building Tier 1 compliance and policy solutions for Amazon Pharmacy.
The tools I build keep things legal for the business and safe for the patients.
They're always up, respond in single-digit ms, and impact every every pharmacy transaction.

I was an [award-winning](/portfolio/#awardsscholarships) Masters Student in Computer Science,
where I helped build some incredible [research software for Microbiome Science](https://qiime2.org/)
with the [Caporaso Lab](https://caporasolab.us/). I also got to moonlight as a bioinformatician
working with 16s rRNA sequence and qPCR data.
Research! Provenance! Automation! Collaboration! Whee!
I love Python, tolerate Java, respect C, am very intrigued by Rust,
and take great satisfaction in making things go.

I am *deeply motivated to build software that makes the world a better place*,
particularly by supporting positive outcomes for wilderness and climate,
improving health access and outcomes, advancing human knowledge,
and building tools that work for people first.

If your organization fits *any* of those descriptions, please [get in touch](mailto:chriskeefe@nau.edu).
I am open for work in North America or Europe and would love to talk with you.

I believe in well-made things, hard work, good food, and human connection.
When I'm not geeking out on open technology, you'll find me
