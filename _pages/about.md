I'm Chris, an [award-winning](/portfolio/#awardsscholarships) Masters Student in Computer Science.
I develop [research software for Microbiome Science](https://qiime2.org/)
with the [Caporaso Lab](https://caporasolab.us/)
and occasionally moonlight as a bioinformatician, working with 16s rRNA sequence and qPCR data.
I love Python, respect C, am very intrigued by Rust, and take great satisfaction in
making things go.

I am *deeply motivated to build software that makes the world a better place*,
particularly by supporting positive outcomes for wilderness and climate,
improving health access and outcomes, advancing human knowledge,
and building tools that work for people first.

If your organization fits *any* of that description, please [get in touch](mailto:chriskeefe@nau.edu).
I am open for work in North America or Europe beginning in August/September 2022,
and would love to talk with you.

I believe in well-made things, hard work, good food, and human connection.
When I'm not geeking out on open technology, you'll find me
[reading a book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/765208-chris-keefe),

cooking something extravagant,
or wandering in the woods somewhere.
